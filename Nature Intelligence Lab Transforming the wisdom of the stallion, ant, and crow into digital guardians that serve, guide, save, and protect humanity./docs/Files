# 🐎 STALLION OPS Algorithm – Overview

STALLION OPS is a **system operations controller** that manages performance like a war stallion:

- `SPRINT` – short bursts of maximum speed for critical operations  
- `PACE` – default stable performance for continuous work  
- `RECOVER` – cooling state to protect hardware and risk exposure  

Key Inputs:
- CPU load & temperature  
- Memory usage  
- I/O pressure  
- Risk index (for financial / cyber contexts)  
- Mission priority (NORMAL / IMPORTANT / CRITICAL)

Output:
- Chosen state + scheduler / power adjustments.

Implementation: [`src/stallion_ops.py`](../src/stallion_ops.py).
