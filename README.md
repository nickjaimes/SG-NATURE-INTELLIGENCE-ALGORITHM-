# 🌿 SG NATURE INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS  
**STALLION OPS · ANT SWARM · CROW STRATEGIC**

> *"Nature already wrote the algorithms.  
We simply translate them into systems that protect humanity."*  
— Nicolas E. Santiago, Safeway Guardian

This repository contains three **nature-inspired operational algorithms** used in the broader **SAFEWAY GUARDIAN** ecosystem:

- 🐎 **STALLION OPS Algorithm** – High-performance ops controller (sprint / pace / recover)  
- 🐜 **ANT SWARM Algorithm** – Distributed optimization inspired by ant colonies  
- 🦅 **CROW STRATEGIC Algorithm** – Long-memory, threat-aware strategic decision engine  

They are implemented in **Python** as reference versions and can be ported into **Rust, Go, C++** or integrated into **SG QUANTUM OS, SG STALLION OS, SG STOCK MASTER, SG CYBER SHIELD**, and other modules.

## 🧠 Algorithm Overview

### 1. 🐎 STALLION OPS Algorithm

A **system operations controller** that behaves like a stallion:

- Delivers **short bursts of maximum performance** when critical
- Maintains **stable pace** for long-running tasks
- Enters **recovery mode** to prevent burnout (thermal, memory, risk)

Use cases:
- SG STALLION OS scheduler  
- SG STOCK MASTER high-volatility trading bursts  
- SG CYBER SHIELD active-defense mode

Details: see [`docs/STALLION_OPS.md`](docs/STALLION_OPS.md).

### 2. 🐜 ANT SWARM Algorithm

A lightweight **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**-style engine:

- Multiple “digital ants” explore solution space  
- They leave “pheromones” on good solutions  
- Over time, best paths are reinforced → near-optimal solution

Use cases:
- Route optimization (supply chain, logistics)  
- Task allocation across distributed nodes  
- Finding good configurations in large search spaces

Details: see [`docs/ANT_SWARM.md`](docs/ANT_SWARM.md).

### 3. 🦅 CROW STRATEGIC Algorithm

Inspired by crow intelligence:

- Crows **remember threats and good food locations for years**  
- They warn others and **do not repeat mistakes**

The algorithm models:

- **Memory of past states** (good & bad)  
- **Threat/risk mapping**  
- **Preference for strategies that worked** + avoidance of those that failed

Use cases:
- SG CYBER SHIELD (attacker memory, blacklists)  
- SG STOCK MASTER (avoid repeated losing patterns)  
- SG Governance simulation (don’t repeat past crises)

Details: see [`docs/CROW_STRATEGIC.md`](docs/CROW_STRATEGIC.md).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SG-NATURE-INTELLIGENCE-ALGORITHMS.git
cd SG-NATURE-INTELLIGENCE-ALGORITHMS
2. (Optional) Create virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you add one later

3. Run demo
python examples/demo_all_algorithms.py
You will see:
   •   STALLION OPS cycling through SPRINT / PACE / RECOVER
   •   ANT SWARM converging on a short path
   •   CROW STRATEGIC choosing actions based on memory
